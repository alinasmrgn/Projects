1. In the folder 'SQL_Analysis,' you can find my project for the Epam course on SQL Analysis of Google apps:

Google play store apps
In this project I'm going to evaluate different app attributes to decide which characteristics are better perceived by the market. Attributes that's going to be evaluated are app rating, rating count, category. Evaluation parameters are app's average number of reactions (count of rating scores assigned) and / or number installs, and correlation between rating and the percentage of rating count to installs. High number of rating count tells us about the demand for the application and high potential income. High number of rating count tells us about the demand for the application and high potential income indicates that the audience is more loyal to such type of applications. The final result will be a full set of application characteristics, determined by indirect evidence.

My work consisted of several parts:

search for a suitable dataset;
loading the date of the set into the database in denormalized form;
data processing;
development and creation of a database schema;
loading data into the database;
writing SQL queries to the database;
data visualization.

3. In the folder 'Course_work' you can find my university course work as a part of the "Database and Application Administration" discipline:

The objective of this course project is to develop a database intended for the "Household Goods Store" application. The application will possess the following functionality:
- User authentication.
- Ability to add products to the cart.
- Ability to remove products from the cart.
- Ability to edit the cart.
- Viewing available products.
- Categorization of products.
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a combination of software and linguistic tools of general or specific purpose that provide management of database creation and utilization.

For the development and management of the course project's database, the Oracle Database 12c relational database management system was used due to its performance and reliability. Additionally, the graphical interface Oracle SQL Developer was employed for its intuitive clarity and broad spectrum of capabilities.
