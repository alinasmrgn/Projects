Google play store apps

In this project I'm going to evaluate different app attributes to decide which characteristics are better perceived by the market.
Attributes that's going to be evaluated are app rating, rating count, category. 
Evaluation parameters are app's average number of reactions (count of rating scores assigned) and / or number installs, and correlation between rating and the percentage of rating count to installs.
High number of rating count tells us about the demand for the application and high potential income. 
High number of rating count tells us about the demand for the application and high potential income indicates that the audience is more loyal to such type of applications.
The final result will be a full set of application characteristics, determined by indirect evidence.

My work consisted of several parts:
- search for a suitable dataset;
- loading the date of the set into the database in denormalized form;
- data processing;
- development and creation of a database schema;
- loading data into the database;
- writing SQL queries to the database;
- data visualization.
